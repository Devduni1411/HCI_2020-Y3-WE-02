					<h2>A site visit to the College Farm</h2>
					<hr>
                    <img src="assets/rukshan/collegeNews/Induction.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive">
					<br>
                    <p>The Principal, Rev. Fr. Araliya Jayasundara OSB visited the College Farm on Wednesday, 
                        7th October and met with the farm manager 
                        Mr Chandra Amunugama to discuss the present state of work and future developments.</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>It was in the early 1950s Mr William Sinnathamby (called ‘Bill’ by his friends and ‘Sinna’ by his students),
                             with a new vision for promoting agriculture at Trinity, leased out land in Haragama to establish a 
                             new farm with the support of 
                            Principal Mr N.S. Walter and Vice Principal Major Gordon Burrows.</p>
                        <br>    

                        <p>The ‘William Sinnathamby Farm’ to call by its original name,
                             has survived through almost 70 years of ‘glad and melancholy’ days. 
                             The site visit on Wednesday proved to be productive in understanding the actual state of the farm,
                             which, to all those who visited, seemed very promising!</p>
                        <br> 

                        <p>Currently crops such as coconuts, bananas, papayas, turmeric, beans, corns, radishes, tomatoes, 
                            red onions, carrots and beets are grown. 
                            And, being a mixed farm, it has a considerable amount of livestock – cattle,
                             pigs, chickens, rabbits and goats.</p>
